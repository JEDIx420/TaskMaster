## Enhanced Pomodoro Timer with Task Integration

TaskMaster has been enhanced to provide seamless integration between Pomodoro sessions and task management. Here's how to use the new features:

### üçÖ Enhanced Pomodoro Timer Features

#### Task Selection for Work Sessions
1. On the main timer page (`/`), when in **Focus Time** mode, you'll see a task selection dropdown
2. Choose a specific task to work on during your Pomodoro session
3. The timer will display the selected task title and show progress (completed/estimated pomodoros)
4. When the work session completes, the task's completed pomodoros will automatically increment

#### Automatic Task Progress
- Work sessions automatically update the associated task's `completedPomodoros` count
- Tasks are automatically marked as "done" when completed pomodoros reach the estimated amount
- All session data is logged to n8n webhooks (if configured)

#### Session Tracking
- All completed sessions are tracked locally
- Today's session count is displayed below the timer
- Session history includes task association, duration, and timestamps

### üìä Productivity Dashboard

Navigate to the Dashboard page and click the **Stats** tab to view:

#### Focus Session Analytics
- **Today's Sessions**: Total sessions completed today (work + breaks)
- **Focus Time Today**: Total time spent in work sessions (hours and minutes)
- **This Week**: Work sessions completed in the last 7 days
- **Daily Average**: Average sessions per day over the last week

#### Task Management Insights

### üéØ Task Management Integration

#### Creating Tasks with Pomodoro Estimates
1. Use the "Add Task" button in any view (List, Kanban, Calendar)

3. This helps with planning and tracking progress

#### Viewing Task Progress
- In all task views, you can see the pomodoro progress: `(completed/estimated)`
- Tasks automatically move to "Done" status when pomodoro target is reached
- Use the Kanban view to visualize workflow: Backlog ‚Üí Doing ‚Üí Done

### üîó n8n Integration for Session Logging

The enhanced system logs detailed session data to n8n:

#### Session Log Payload
```json
{
  "task": "Task title or 'No task selected'",

  "duration": 1500,  // seconds
  "timestamp": "2025-07-06T15:30:00.000Z",
  "notes": "Optional session notes"
}
```

#### Recommended n8n Workflow

2. **Google Sheets** ‚Üí Logs to a "Sessions" sheet with columns:
   - `id`, `task`, `type`, `duration`, `timestamp`, `notes`
3. **Optional**: Send Slack/email notifications for completed work sessions
